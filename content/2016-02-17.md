The most beautiful math equation is:
$$e^{i\pi}+1=0$$

Recently a colleague of mine said that there are final year students that do not know how to go logarithms. Hence I decided to post the basic rules of logarithms for those who have forgotten about it.

1. $\log_am+\log_an=\log_a(mn)$
2. $\log_am-\log_an=\log_a\left(\dfrac{m}{n}\right)$
